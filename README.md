**CAPSTONE PROJECT**
As a performance engineer, I want to build a predictive model that estimates system resource usage—such as CPU, memory, and thread utilization—based on the distribution of API usage within an application. Currently, predicting how different API load mixes will impact system resources requires extensive performance testing with multiple load distributions.

This project will use Linear Regression (and possibly other regression methods) to model the relationship between API usage patterns and resulting resource consumption. Given input data describing the percentage load distribution across different APIs, the model will predict the expected resource usage. This will help in capacity planning and reduce the need for repeated, costly performance testing scenarios.*
